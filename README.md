# HAND-GESTURE-RECOGNITION-USING-MEDIAPIPE
Developed a hand gesture recognition system using Mediapipe, an open-source framework by Google. The project captures real-time video, applies Mediapipe's hand tracking to identify 21 key landmarks, and classifies gestures using machine learning. This system enables applications in UI control, sign language recognition, and VR.
